      <google-codelab-step label="Creating a Hadoop Cluster with a Jupyter Notebook" duration="4">
        <h2 is-upgraded><strong>Cluster Creation </strong></h2>
<p>Please navigate to DataProc, which is GCP&#39;s Hadoop product:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 441.00px" src="img\\eb5e1aa13466b75c.png"></p>
<p>Hit &#34;create cluster&#34;:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 306.00px" src="img\\2f82c4f00a4b7fdb.png"></p>
<p>If applicable, select &#34;Cluster on Compute Engine&#34;:</p>
<p>You need to use the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name: &#34;your initials-hadoop&#34; (e.g. pk-hadoop)</li>
<li>Region: leave the default region (us-central1)</li>
<li>Cluster mode: leave the default mode &#34;Standard (1 master, N workers)&#34;</li>
</ul>
<p>Important: Scroll down and &#34;Jupyter Notebook&#34; in the section &#34;Components&#34;:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 531.00px" src="img\\77b3e3d80dc16032.png"></p>
<p>Next, select &#34;Configure Nodes (optional)&#34; and switch to a smaller machine type for both, the &#34;Manager node&#34; as well as the &#34;Worker nodes&#34;. </p>
<p>You will first need to change the primary disk type to Standard Persistent Disk for the master and the workers:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\\9c02589c1ec83c4.png"></p>
<p>Please also reduce the size of the attached hard disks for both node types:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\\5e9ca66f4be999bf.png"></p>
<p>Set a bucket in which the cluster is able to store its data to be persisted (please use your own bucket):</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\\fe01fedf7f515850.png"></p>
<p>Please also allow access to the whole project for the cluster as follows:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\\589c427f6a78a9a2.png"></p>
<p>Leave the remaining fields with their default val1ues and click on &#34;Create&#34;.</p>
<aside class="warning"><p><strong>Please note: </strong>Cluster creation takes a few minutes. Don&#39;t forget to delete the cluster later, since it induces high costs!</p>

<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Results</strong></h2>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>You configured and started a Hadoop cluster which is ready for our first batch processing job.</li>
</ol>

      <google-codelab-step label="Accessing the Jupyter Notebook and Reading the Data Lake" duration="8">
        <h2 is-upgraded><strong>Opening the Jupyter Notebook</strong></h2>
<p>Click onto the link to your cluster:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\\fecef524aa90829.png"></p>
<p>When clicking on &#34;VM instances&#34; one can see that the three virtual machines are running. We will later use this to connect to the master node. </p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\\79ab5e10fefde260.png"></p>
<p>For now, we only want to use the web interface of the Jupyter notebook. Click on &#34;Web Interfaces&#34; and &#34;Jupyter&#34;:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\\b528b442b9527da4.png"></p>
<p>You should see a Jupyter Notebook environment:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\\28ca01b8ce755e10.png"></p>
<p>Let&#39;s create a notebook in Cloud Storage, i.e. navigate to GCS and click &#34;New&#34; â†’ &#34;PySpark&#34;:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\\2b48d49a613316c2.png"></p>
<aside class="warning"><p><strong>Please note: </strong>With this method we work in an &#34;interactive mode&#34; with our big data cluster. Usually, one submits single jobs (especially in production mode) as source code files. However, for our purposes the interactive mode works well. We should, however, always close the PySpark interactive notebook by clicking on &#34;Running&#34; and shutting in down. <strong>Also remember: please open only one PySpark notebook in parallel!</strong></p>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded>Connecting to the PySpark session and reading the data lake</h2>
<p>Although we don&#39;t know yet what Spark or PySpark is in general, we can use it quickly with our Python knowledge. The &#34;entry point&#34; to our big data cluster in PySpark is the so-called SparkContext. You can check if everything is fine and accessible by just entering &#34;sc&#34; in one cell. It may take some seconds until the cell shows the output.</p>
<pre><code>sc</code></pre>
<p>This should be the output: </p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\\1476ff3e1650df0c.png"></p>
<aside class="warning"><p><strong>Please note: </strong>The indicator on the top-right should not be filled. Especially if you accidentally opened two PySpark notebooks, one will have this circle always filled in dark-grey.</p>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Renaming the Notebook</strong></h2>
<p>You may also now want to rename the notebook (click on &#34;Untitled&#34; and change the name to, e.g., &#34;Batch Processing 1 (Fundamentals)&#34;).</p>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Sample Batch Task (this time calculated in &#34;big data mode&#34; by all nodes in the cluster)</strong></h2>
<p>A batch job could be to read all csv-files in the webshop_datalake (we only have one file currently stored there) and calculate the average sales value per product. Note that we assume that all files in the webshop_datalake have the same structure.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded><strong>Connecting to the data lake</strong></h3>
<p>Let&#39;s start by defining the connection to the data lake for PySpark. Put the following code in a cell and execute it (no output is expected):</p>
<pre><code># provide spark the link to the webshop history (datalake)
df = spark.read.csv(&#34;gs://hdm-kueppers/webshop_history.csv&#34;, inferSchema=True, header=True)</code></pre>
<h3 is-upgraded><strong>Batch Processing</strong></h3>
<p>Next, let&#39;s define our batch processing by making use of one of Spark&#39;s great features: querying big data in a SQL manner. The cell should have a Pandas DataFrame as output.</p>
<pre><code># create a temporary view on the data that we can simply query by SQL
df.createOrReplaceTempView(&#34;sales&#34;)

# this is our batch processing - calculate the mean sales_value per product_name
df_batch_result = spark.sql(&#34;SELECT product_name, mean(sales_value) FROM sales GROUP BY product_name&#34;)

# show results (interactive mode)
df_batch_result.toPandas()</code></pre>
<p>Your notebook should now look like this:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\\73c48cdc598938c.png"></p>
<aside class="special"><p><strong>Please note: </strong>This time we did not load the data into the memory of the Jupyter Notebook machine (except for the results table). All processing (although not visible) has been conducted by the worker nodes (indicated by the log output we see in the red boxes after executing a PySpark-shell). If the data volume grows, we could just add more workers and the computation time will stay stable (parallel processing). This is horizontally scalable big data processing.</p>
</aside>
<h3 is-upgraded><strong>Creating the Batch View</strong></h3>
<p>Finally, we don&#39;t want to stay in interactive mode, but write the batch processing results back to the cloud storage.</p>
<pre><code># write results back to cloud GCS
df_batch_result.write.csv(&#34;gs://hdm-kueppers/webshop_batch_results/average_sales_per_product&#34;)</code></pre>
<p>There is no output expected. However, in your bucket, you should see a folder &#34;average_sales_per_product&#34; containing multiple files which hold our batch processing results. We will later discuss why there is not only one results-file (do you already have an idea? Think about parallel processing.). This should be your bucket&#39;s content:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\\cb6a4a22d18562df.png"></p>
<p>Please note: You might see less than three part-files.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded><strong>Examining the result (downloading one file)</strong></h3>
<p>When downloading and opening one file (with more than 0 B size!), you&#39;ll see that it contains a partial result:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\\e0969f0b16cfcf92.png"></p>
<p>Thus, batch processing may require a further step to consolidate the results into a &#34;batch view&#34;, e.g. by generating a BigQuery table. We will skip this step, which is however simply possible.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Results</strong></h2>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>You used a Jupyter Notebook as an interactive big data tool for batch processing.</li>
<li>The code you ran is big data-ready and scalable. If you need more performance, just add more worker nodes in cluster creation and you are ready to process terabytes of data in a batch manner.</li>
<li>We can now shut down our cluster in order to save money (see next step).</li>
</ol>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Shutting Down the Cluster" duration="2">
        <p>Important: In case you want to continue with the next lab, you can omit this step and delete the cluster later.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Reasoning</strong></h2>
<p>Within the cloud environment you pay by use. Since the DataProc Cluster costs ~3$ per day, we now want to tear it down. Unfortunately, DataProc does not allow &#34;stopping&#34; the cluster (like cloud SQL did). Thus, we&#39;ll need to delete the cluster to avoid costs.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Saving and closing the notebooks</strong></h2>
<p>Save your Jupyter Notebook. </p>
<aside class="special"><p><strong>Please note: </strong>The notebook will be available later on since it is also stored in GCS. You should see a bucket called &#34;dataproc-staging-...&#34; in your GCS storage which holds - among other files - the notebook (in the &#34;notebooks&#34; folder)..</p>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Shutting down the DataProc Cluster</strong></h2>
<p>Go to the cluster details page and hit &#34;Delete&#34;:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\\d7e556be81ad1f6f.png"></p>
