      <google-codelab-step label="Introduction" duration="0">
        <p>We now want to get in touch with the &#34;classical&#34; big data technologies in the Hadoop context. HDFS for big data storage is the first component of Hadoop that we want to get to know.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded><strong>Goal</strong></h3>
<p>Understanding HDFS in the DataProc environment and interacting with the filesystem in a basic manner.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>What you&#39;ll implement</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Setup a big data-ready computation environment (Hadoop in the cloud)</li>
<li>Upload files to / download files from the cluster HDFS.</li>
<li>Browse the cluster HDFS </li>
</ul>
<aside class="warning"><p><strong>Please note:</strong> You&#39;ll need GCP access for this lab. The provided voucher needs to be redeemed.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Creating a Hadoop Cluster with a Jupyter Notebook" duration="4">
        <h2 is-upgraded><strong>Cluster Creation</strong></h2>
<p>Please create the cluster in analogy to the lab &#34;Fundamentals: Batch Processing&#34;.</p>
<aside class="warning"><p><strong>Please note: </strong>Cluster creation takes a few minutes.</p>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Results</strong></h2>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>You configured and started a Hadoop cluster which is ready for using HDFS.</li>
</ol>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Accessing HDFS from the shell" duration="8">
        <h2 is-upgraded><strong>Connecting to the cluster&#39;s master node </strong></h2>
<p>HDFS is running in our cluster. Unlike cloud storage, this service is tightly bound to the DataProc instance and especially &#34;gone&#34; when we delete the cluster. Thus, we&#39;ll only use HDFS for one-time demonstration purposes. Our &#34;long-term&#34; data lake for example will be based on cloud storage, since this can be accessed by all services in GCP.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\\fecef524aa90829.png"></p>
<p>When clicking on &#34;VM instances&#34; one can see that the three virtual machines are running. </p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\\221f964cc442eb76.png"></p>
<aside class="special"><p><strong>Important</strong>: We&#39;ll use the master node as an intermediary to access HDFS and upload a text file to it. The reason for this is that GCP copes for security a lot and it is not simple to access our DataProc cluster and its HDFS from outside the GCP project. The master node is of course able to access HDFS, since it is managed by this node (the NameNode service is running on the master node). Thus, our workaround is that we connect to the master node via SSH (i.e. get a terminal shell on the master node) and interact with the HDFS from there.</p>
</aside>
<p>Click on &#34;SSH&#34; next to the master node. A window should pop up and after a few seconds, you should be connected to the Hadoop master node machine&#39;s shell.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\\9874f4e3fd504183.png"></p>
<aside class="warning"><p><strong>Important: </strong>We&#39;ll use the master node&#39;s shell now only as an &#34;access point&#34; to the cluster&#39;s HDFS. This means that especially the files we will be uploading to HDFS are not stored on the master node (except for intermediate upload purposes), but in a distributed manner in our Hadoop cluster.</p>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded>Listing the top-most directory in our cluster HDFS</h2>
<p>All commands to interact with the cluster are started with &#34;hadoop fs&#34;. You can list the top-most directory (&#34;/&#34;) of our HDFS with this command, showing three directories (hadoop, tmp, and user)</p>
<pre><code>hadoop fs -ls /</code></pre>
<p>This should be the output: </p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\\9133cf34a8fdfe8d.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Uploading a text file</h2>
<p>Our goal is to upload the text file &#34;lorem_ipsum.txt&#34; located in the datasets folder (in the course materials) to HDFS.</p>
<aside class="warning"><p><strong>Please note: </strong>Usually, one would ingest source data directly from source tables into HDFS (via an ETL tool like sqoop, Data Fusion, etc. - we&#39;ll discuss this later). This proceeding via the master node is just for demo purposes.</p>
</aside>
<h3 is-upgraded><strong>Upload a text file to the master virtual machine</strong></h3>
<p>Let&#39;s start our workaround and first upload the file to the master node. Go to the pop up window containing the shell, click on the small gear icon and select &#34;Upload file&#34;.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\\8ba18e187234bcf8.png"></p>
<p>Select lorem_ipsum.txt on your local machine which you downloaded from the course materials folder. When finished, you can enter &#34;ls&#34; in the shell and check if the file shows up:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\\ef18c883309c966d.png"></p>
<h3 is-upgraded><strong>Load the text file from the master into HDFS</strong></h3>
<p>Next, let&#39;s upload the file to the HDFS temporary directory &#34;/tmp&#34;:</p>
<pre><code>hadoop fs -put lorem_ipsum.txt /tmp</code></pre>
<h3 is-upgraded><strong>Further Interact with HDFS</strong></h3>
<p>Check if the upload worked with this command:</p>
<pre><code>hadoop fs -ls /tmp</code></pre>
<p>You can take a look at the last lines of the file with this command (it is a normal text file with some made-up text):</p>
<pre><code>hadoop fs -cat /tmp/lorem_ipsum.txt</code></pre>
<p>Your shell should look like this: </p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\\bb168b3527f51906.png"></p>
<p>You can close the SSH window now.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Results</strong></h2>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>You connected via SSH to the DataProc (Hadoop) cluster&#39;s master node.</li>
<li>You uploaded a file from your system to this master node&#39;s (local) filesystem as a workaround.</li>
<li>You uploaded a file from the master node&#39;s local filesystem to HDFS via the hadoop shell command &#34;hadoop fs -put&#34;.</li>
<li>You interacted with HDFS via the hadoop shell commands (ls and tail)</li>
</ol>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Browsing the Filesystem via the NameNode WebUI" duration="2">
        <h2 is-upgraded><strong>Connecting to the NameNode&#39;s WebUI</strong></h2>
<p>Navigate in the GCP cloud console to the DataProc cluster&#39;s tab &#34;Web interfaces&#34;:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\\6c819c0d64c8f02d.png"></p>
<p>Select HDFS NameNode. The WebUI of the NameNode is opened (which is running on the master node of our cluster):</p>
<p>There, you can show for example how many active DataNodes participate in our HDFS cluster:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\\c7e1678250b1e4f0.png"></p>
<p>Under Utilities you&#39;ll find a (rudimentary) browsing tool for the HDFS filesystem:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\\5d9bf882172d8029.png"></p>
<p>You should see the uploaded file &#34;lorem_ipsum.txt&#34; there also:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\\6792fd125bbc18e8.png"></p>
<aside class="warning"><p><strong>Please note: </strong>The WebUI has an upload button, however this function does not work. Therefore, we used the SSH workaround above. </p>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Results</strong></h2>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>You learned how to use the NameNode&#39;s WebUI which provides some information about the HDFS cluster.</li>
<li>You interacted with HDFS from the NameNode&#39;s WebUI, especially showing folders and files.</li>
</ol>

      <google-codelab-step label="Shutting Down the Cluster" duration="2">
        <p>Important: In case you want to continue with the next lab, you can omit this step and delete the cluster later.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Reasoning</strong></h2>
<p>Within the cloud environment you pay by use. Since the DataProc Cluster costs ~3$ per day, we now want to tear it down. Unfortunately, DataProc does not allow &#34;stopping&#34; the cluster (like cloud SQL did). Thus, we&#39;ll need to delete the cluster to avoid costs.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Shutting down the DataProc Cluster</strong></h2>
<p>Go to the cluster details page and hit &#34;Delete&#34;:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\\d7e556be81ad1f6f.png"></p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Congratulations" duration="1">
        <p>Congratulations, you now got in touch with a &#34;classical big data file system&#34;, HDFS. </p>
<aside class="special"><p><strong>Please note: </strong>Please do not shut down your DataProc cluster. You can now close this lab.</p>
